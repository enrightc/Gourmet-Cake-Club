## Bugs

### Issue

- When testing on a mobile phone display I noticed the hero image was not rednering correctly. It was zoomed in on a small section of the image.

### Resolution

- I worked through the properties in the CSS for the background image and was able to isoalte that the "fixed" value in the "background" property was causing the issue.
