# BUGS

### Fixed Bugs

#### Hero Image Rendering Issue on Mobile Devices

- Issue: The hero image does not render correctly on mobile devices, resulting in a zoomed-in view on a small section of the image.
- Description: During testing on a mobile phone display, it was observed that the hero image was not rendering as expected. The issue was identified to be related to the "fixed" value in the background property, causing the image to display incorrectly and eliminating the intended parallax effect.
- Expected Behavior: The hero image should render correctly on all devices, including mobile, without sacrificing the intended parallax effect.
- Steps to Reproduce:
  - Access the website on a mobile device.
  - Observe the rendering of the hero image, noting the zoomed-in view.
- Investigation and Solution:
  - Reviewed CSS properties for the background image.
  - Identified that the "fixed" value in the background property was causing the rendering issue.
  - Removed the "fixed" value, resolving the rendering problem but sacrificing the parallax effect.

### Known Bugs (unresolved)

#### Navigation Bar Overlaps Section Headings

- Issue: When clicking on a link to jump to a specific section of the page, the fixed navigation bar overlaps the headings of that section, making them partially or entirely hidden from view.
- Description: The fixed navigation bar does not account for the presence of section headings, causing a visual obstruction when navigating to specific sections. This affects the user experience as essential information becomes concealed, impacting the clarity of the content.
- Expected Behavior: When the user uses a link to navigate to a section of the page the section sub-headings should be visible without any overlap or obstruction from the navigation bar.
- Steps to Reproduce:
  - Navigate to any page with multiple sections.
  - Click on a link in the fixed navigation bar to jump to a specific section.
- investigation and Solution:
  - Added padding to the top of the container. Now when the user clociks the links the relevant headings are visible. 

#### Cursor Not Changing to Pointer on Safari

- Issue: On the Safari browser, when hovering over links, the cursor does not change to the expected pointer icon as it does on other browsers.
- Description: The default cursor behavior is not being observed on Safari when hovering over clickable links. Users may expect a visual cue, such as a pointer icon, to indicate a interactive link. This non-standard behavior can cause confusion and impact the perceived responsiveness of the website.
- Expected Behavior: When hovering over links, the cursor should change to a pointer icon across all browsers, providing a clear indication to users that the element is clickable.
- Steps to Reproduce:
  - Open the website on Safari.
