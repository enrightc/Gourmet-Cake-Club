                    <h2>Recipe</h2>
                    <p>Preparation:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Preheat your oven to 177°C. Grease three 20 cm round pans with nonstick spray and line 
                            the bottoms with parchment paper cut into circles. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick 
                            spray and lightly dust the pans with cocoa powder. Tap out any excess and set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on 
                            medium-low speed until light and fluffy. Mix in the Nutella until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, 
                            mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed and beat in the vanilla.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With the mixer on low speed, gradually add half of the flour mixture, followed by the buttermilk, and then 
                            the remaining flour mixture. Beat just until combined; the batter will be thick.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, spreading it to the edges with an offset spatula. Bake for 
                            25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few dry crumbs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes. Invert them onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment paper, and let the cakes 
                            cool completely.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>For the Frosting:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            In a stand mixer bowl, combine egg whites, sugar, and salt. Place the bowl over simmering water, whisking continuously until 
                            the mixture reaches 65°C and the sugar is fully dissolved.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer, fit it with the whisk attachment, and beat on medium speed until the mixture resembles 
                            shaving cream and cools slightly (1-2 minutes).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Switch to the paddle attachment and gradually add butter, one tablespoon at a time, until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the 
                            sides of the bowl and beat on medium-high until light and fluffy (about 30 seconds). Don't worry if it looks curdled; 
                            it will come together.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add Nutella and continue mixing until incorporated. If the frosting is too thick, mix on medium-low to slightly deflate the 
                            egg whites and thin it out.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Assembly:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Place one cake layer on a serving platter, spread 1 cup of frosting to the edges. Repeat with the second layer, topping it with 1 
                            cup of frosting. Add the third layer and cover the top and sides of the cake with frosting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sprinkle with chocolate shavings if desired. Enjoy this indulgent Nutella chocolate cake!

            <h3>Tips for Baking Success</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Buttermilk Magic:</strong> Buttermilk plays a crucial role in this recipe, particularly due to the
                    presence of baking soda. The
                    acidity in buttermilk neutralises the baking soda, eliminating any lingering off-flavours. If you find yourself
                    without
                    buttermilk, a quick substitute can be made by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to a 1-cup liquid
                    measuring
                    cup. Fill the cup with whole milk, stir, and let it sit for 5 minutes before use. Repeat this process for every
                    cup of
                    buttermilk required in the recipe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Handle with Care:</strong> This cake boasts a soft and delicate texture. For optimal results, allow the
                    layers to cool and chill
                    before applying the frosting. Additionally, chilling the frosted cake before slicing ensures clean and neat
                    portions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cocoa Powder Coating:</strong> Prevent the cake from sticking to the pans by dusting the insides with
                    cocoa powder. Unlike flour,
                    cocoa powder seamlessly blends with the dark cake color, ensuring a flawless appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Embrace Room Temperature:</strong> Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature. Cold eggs can be
                    challenging to blend into
                    cake batter without overworking it, and cold buttermilk may cause the butter to resolidify, leading to batter
                    curdling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Precision Weighing:</strong> For the finest results, consider weighing your ingredients. Small kitchen
                    scales are a relatively
                    inexpensive yet invaluable tool for achieving accuracy in your baking endeavors.

            <h3>Planning ahead</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Room Temperature Bliss:</strong> Keep the frosted cake in a cake keeper at room temperature for up to 3
                    days or refrigerate for up to 5 days. Bring it to
                    room temperature before serving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frozen Delight:</strong> Freeze the frosted cake for up to 2 months. Thaw it overnight in the
                    refrigerator and bring it to room temperature just
                    before serving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layer Preparation:</strong> Alternatively, wrap the baked and cooled cake layers in plastic wrap and
                    store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days
                    before frosting and serving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frosting Freedom:</strong> Prepare the frosting one day in advance, keeping it refrigerated in an
                    airtight container. Bring it to room temperature
                    and re-whip before using.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frozen Flavour:</strong> The frosting can also be frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator
                    overnight, bring it to room temperature,
                    and re-whip before using for a delightful frozen treat.
